// Background upgrade of the ASTC -> BC7 disk cache ([gfx] astc_quality = high; implementation nvn_texup.cpp).
//
// The first time a texture is needed and the cache has no entry of the high preset for it, the render thread (or a texprep job) uses what is there
// (an entry of the fast preset, or a fast transcode made on the spot, exactly as before) and hands a snapshot of the texture's source bytes to this pool.
// A worker thread untiles the snapshot, decodes the ASTC and encodes it again with the slow bc7e preset, then writes the cache entry. The next start
// finds the entry and the texture comes out sharper at no cost. The workers run at below-normal priority, a few threads only (the game keeps the
// cores), and stop within a fraction of a second when the GPU layer shuts down; half-finished work is dropped, never written.
